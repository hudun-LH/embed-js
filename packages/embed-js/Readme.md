# embed-js
> A lightweight JavaScript plugin to embed emojis, media, maps, tweets, code and services.

## Installation

To install the stable version:
```
npm install --save embed-js
```
## CDN
https://unpkg.com/embed-js

## Basic Usage

**You need to use plugins or presets to do anything. By defauly embed-js does nothing.**

Let's assume that the HTML structure is as written below

``` html
<div id="element">
   <!--===== your string here =======-->
</div>
```

Creating an instance of embed.js

``` javascript
import EmbedJS from 'embed-js'
import { url, emoji } from 'embed-js/src/plugins'

const x = new EmbedJS({
  input: document.getElementById('element'),
  plugins: [
    url(),
    emoji()
  ]
})
```

Next step is replacing the original text with the processed text.

``` javascript
//Render the result
x.render();
```

There may be cases where you just want the processed string to use it according to your need. You can get it by the following method. This can
be used on the server side to get the string. Still if the plugin involves interactions, you will have to load it on
the client side.

``` javascript
//Get the resulting string
x.text().then(({ result }) => {
  console.log(result); //The resulting string
})
```

If you wan't to destroy the instance. It will also replace the processed string with the original string.

``` javascript
//Destroy the instance
x.destroy()
```
